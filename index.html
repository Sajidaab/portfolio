            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>My name is Sajida, I am Lebanese of origins, and have lived in Canada for the past 9 years. One of my favourite people to spend time with would be my nephew Adnan. I also love taking care of my 4 years old cat Leo. Beyond my affection for my four-legged friend, some of my hobbies consist of mainly arts, such as painting, photography, designing, content creation, as well as travelling. My future goals is to live surrounded by my family, be a successful graphic designer, and explore and capture the world through my lens.  </p>

            <h4>Conclusion?</h4>
            <p>In conclusion, it seems that cats come with a 'no-disadvantage' label, making them the purr-fect addition to any home, therefore everyone should own at least one ;D </p>
